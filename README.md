# Principal-Component-Analysis

## Principal Component Analysis is used to perform dimensionality reduction on datasets, which is the idea of removing unnecessary portions and reducing computational costs. During PCA, the initial dataset goes through some sort of transformation from its original coordinate system to a new coordinate system, where the axis is determined by the two greatest variance directions of the inital datset.
